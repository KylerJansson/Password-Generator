# Password-Generator

## Description

I have created this password generator to assist in making random secure passwords for the user.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

In order to use this generator, you click generate password and a prompt will ask you how many characters you want in your password (between 8-128 characters).
Confirm prompts will then ask you if you would like to include lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers, and special characters.
In the text box will appear your newly generated password!
